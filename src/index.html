                <p>"I was soooo happy when I arrived at Google because it was always my wish to see the building.
                  Google changed my mindset by showing me that anything is possible if you trust yourself. I was
                  very interested to know all about Google and the projects that they are working on in the next
                  coming years. I was also happy because of the art and technology that they were improving for
                  people. I thank Tswello for allowing us to see Google and experience things we didn't know."</p>

                <p>"For me Google was one place I never thought I would see. I thought that Google only existed in
                  the State. I personally enjoyed my experience at Google. It was really exciting and seeing the
                  cultural setting of Google and the information I got was mind blowing. I never thought that
                  there are connecting wires under the ocean. Learning that there are different data center's all
                  around the world and learning that there are different people in the field working together to
                  keep the google center's up and running taught me that teamwork really makes the
                  dreamwork. Hoping that one day we might appear in your offices again. Thank you"</p>

                  life easy when using the internet. The information opened my mind to more ideas of exploring
                  the internet, making an app and testing how the app is reacting or follows the instructions
                  given to it. This shows me that there is a variety of many fields of connecting people by using
                  internet. Building projects that tackle poor countries and also that even if you have reach the
                  height that you wanted to, the skies are unlimited. I can even reach unimaginable heights. I
                  hope that I can go to other events that broaden my information that can better build my skills
                  in the future"</p>

                  thankful for the opportunity. First thing I loved was the tradition of keeping things colorful. I got
                  to know more about what takes place and how it looks like behind the actual web. When they
                  mentioned that they do not only focus on technology but also about giving or providing
                  information to us, I also found out that they are also involved in helping disabled people which
                  is the best part because Google is inclusive and acknowledges disabled people. Google also
                  woke me up and showed me that Computer Science is not for men only, but also us women,
                  belong in the IT world if you work hard"</p>

                  Google office I could not explain the rollercoaster of emotions I felt. I really enjoyed myself and I
                  had the privilege of learning from people who are experienced in the google line of work. With
                  that experince and the layer of foundation in my own knowledge and motivation. I trust myself
